# machine_learning
playing around with python to make a library for machine learning

this project is beimg used to estimate if a cv is good or not to automate the hire process it uses key word list and cvs to go through and find the selected words the word list currently has a a list of words and weights correspoding to the words , my idea is that since the weight are estimated by myself i will model the data by collecting data running it through the random forrest code i have made myself that uses pandas and random as the only imports to get a grasp on what weight are the most significant and to assien vaule based on count per leaf of given trees avarage divided by total and to update the weight with every new new piece of data being added to the orignal csv that will tell me who is using the data

there is also a data_clean.py is a list of functions that will automaticly drop columns which are mostly empty , function that recives input from the user to drop columns that are id style points as to not interfere with any machine leanring algorithms in future and then finaly for any remaining empty point using the k nearest algorithm to fill in empty spaces, to finish with a completly preped csv file ready for a Trees_pd.py
